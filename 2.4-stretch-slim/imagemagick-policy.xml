<!--
  The policy.xml file is used by Imagemagick to define a security policy.

  In our case we want to only allow the processing of safe image formats, and prevent any
  use of Imagemagick's other functions like PDF or movie handling, since those are often implicated in security vulnerabilities.

  Information on previously reported Imagemagick vulnerabilities and policy.xml based mitigations can be found here:
  - https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/08/21/2

  This file should be placed in /etc/Imagemagick-6 (at least on our current Debian distribution).
  We do this by way of a COPY command in the Dockerfile.
  Once the file is in place, you can check if ImageMagick picks it up by issuing the command "convert -list policy" from a regular shell.
